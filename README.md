Module 20 Challenge

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use supervise learning methodology to train and evaluate the model a dataset of historical lending activities from a company. The objective is to find out the relationship between loan status and other variables. 

## Result

- Accuracy scores are shown on the confusion matrix. Based on the matrix, there are 18663 true positive, 563 true negative, 102 false positive, and 56 false negative. As the sum of true positive and true negative is significantly higher than sum of false positive and false negative, the model is considered accurate.
- Precision scores are shown on the classification report. Based on the report, 100% of positive data are correctly classified in positive dataset, and 85% precision rate of negative data are correctly classified in negative dataset.
- Recall scores are shown on the classification report. Based on the report, 99% of recall score indicates that there are 1% of data are incorrectly categorized as negative but are actually positive, 91% of recall score indicates that there are 9% of data are incorrectly categorized as positive but are actually negative.



## Summary
In summary, 99% of data is considered accurate, 100% precision rate on positive data, 85% precision rate on negative data, 99% recall rate on positive data, and 91% recall rate on negative data. After reviewing accuracy scores, precision scores, and recall scores, the machine learning model is considered excellent.
